# NLP-EDA
EDA done on IMDB dataset from Hugging Face

I chose this data as it looked interesting and most relatable.
Below are the steps:
1. Installed datasets using the following command in python from Jupyter Notebook
 "pip install datasets"
2. Inspected the dataset using dataset_builder
3. Loaded IMDB Dataset for Analysis
4. Investigated Data distribution across Split
5. Calculated counts of positive & negative reviews across splits
6. Compared Length of reviews across splits & review type
7. Tokenized Text for Sentiment Analysis
8. Removed stopwords (from nltk + sklearn + punctuations) from Tokenized word lists
9. Plotted most common words from both positive & negative reviews
